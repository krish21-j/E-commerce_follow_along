# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
Milestone 1: Project Overview to summarize what was covered in the session.

In this project, I will be building an E-Commerce app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Here is what I will be learning and working on:

REST API Creation: I will learn how to build scalable APIs to manage users, products, and orders, and get hands-on experience with backend development.

User Authentication: I will implement secure login and registration for users, which is a crucial part of any app that handles sensitive data.

Database Schema Design: I will explore MongoDB to design data models that are efficient and scalable for an e-commerce platform.

Backend Development: I will set up a server with Node.js and Express.js to handle requests, API routes, and interact with the database.

Frontend with React: I will use React to build dynamic, user-friendly interfaces, like product lists and shopping carts.

Milestone 2:

Key Achievements

1. Project Structure: Organized the project into frontend and backend directories for better maintainability. Backend set up with Node.js to handle server-side logic, and the frontend set up with React to build the user interface.

2. React Frontend Setup: Initialized a React app to manage the UI, allowing the e-commerce platform to be interactive.

3. Node.js Backend Setup: Configured a basic Node.js server to lay the foundation for upcoming API integrations and user authentication.

4. Tailwind CSS Configuration: Integrated Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive styling to enhance UI development speed.

5. Login Page Development: Designed and built a functional Login Page with form validation and styling using Tailwind.

Milestone 3:

In this milestone, we focused on building the foundation for the backend of our e-commerce application. The key objectives were to set up a server, connect it to a database, and establish a solid folder structure to keep our code organized.

Backend Folder Structure: We created a structured hierarchy for organizing backend code. This includes dedicated folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware. This structure will make it easier to scale the project as more features are added in future milestones.

Server Setup: We initialized a Node.js server using the Express framework. The server is now configured to handle API requests, and it listens on a designated port for incoming requests.

Database Connection: We integrated MongoDB into the project to store and manage data. The server is now connected to MongoDB, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.

Error Handling: Basic error-handling mechanisms were added to ensure that the server can respond with clear error messages for better debugging and user feedback.
